# LokpalAI Dataset

Welcome to the LokpalAI dataset! This dataset aims to provide a valuable resource for individuals interested in exploring legal cases and gaining a better understanding of the Indian legal system. The LokpalAI dataset is designed as a research tool to mimic the questions that paralegals would ask and to serve as a source of inspiration for common individuals seeking legal insights.

## Dataset Overview

The LokpalAI dataset is generated through a multi-step process that involves referring to relevant cases under different articles of the Indian Constitution, leveraging advanced language processing techniques, and applying summarization methodologies. The dataset is intended to be accessible and user-friendly, catering to common individuals who may not have a legal background.

### Dataset Structure

The LokpalAI dataset is structured as follows:

- Each data instance in the dataset consists of a legal case, accompanied by seed instructions or prompts related to the case.
- The legal case includes various sections such as case citation, bench details, headnotes, legal propositions, case history, legal issues/questions presented, applicable legal provisions, holding, legal reasoning/rationale, concurring and dissenting opinions, implications and significance, and comments/analysis.
- The seed instructions or prompts aim to encourage diverse inquiries and exploration of the legal case, mimicking the questions that paralegals or common individuals would ask.

## Data Generation Process

The LokpalAI dataset is generated through a systematic process that involves multiple steps to ensure the quality and relevance of the data. Here is an overview of the data generation process:

1. **Referring to Cases**: Relevant legal cases are selected based on different articles under the Indian Constitution. These cases are sourced from the website [IndianKanoon.org](https://indiankanoon.org/), which provides a comprehensive collection of legal cases in India.

2. **Summarization with MapReduce Summarize Chain and Palm2**: To summarize the lengthy legal cases, we employ a combination of the MapReduce Summarize Chain from the LangChain library and the Palm2 model.

   - **MapReduce Summarize Chain**: The MapReduce Summarize Chain effectively summarizes various sections of the case, including case citation, bench details, headnotes, legal propositions, case history, legal issues/questions presented, applicable legal provisions, holding, legal reasoning/rationale, concurring and dissenting opinions, implications and significance, and comments/analysis.

   - **Palm2 Model**: In addition to the MapReduce Summarize Chain, we utilize the Palm2 model to further enhance the summarization of lengthy legal documents. The techniques outlined in the [summarization_large_documents_langchain.ipynb](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/language/examples/document-summarization/summarization_large_documents_langchain.ipynb) notebook are utilized to achieve effective summarization.

3. **Self-Instruct Process**: The steps mentioned in the [self-instruct repository](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct) are followed to generate the dataset. Seed instructions or prompts related to the case are provided to mimic the questions that paralegals or common individuals would ask. These prompts encourage diverse inquiries and exploration of the legal cases.

Through this data generation process, we aim to create a comprehensive and research-oriented dataset that allows users to delve into legal cases, gain insights, and explore the nuances of the Indian legal system.
