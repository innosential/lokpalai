Headnotes: This case pertains to the State's liability for the death of a citizen due to a bomb explosion in a state-owned bus. The key issue was whether the State was responsible for failing to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen, specifically the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court held that the State was indeed liable and ordered it to pay compensation to the victim's family.

Legal Proposition: The victim, Irulaiya, was traveling on a state-owned bus when three individuals threw petrol bombs into the bus. Irulaiya was seriously wounded in the explosion and subsequently died in the hospital. The victim's family argued that the State was responsible for their son's death due to its failure to maintain law and order and protect the life of its citizens.

Case History: The case was initially heard in the lower court, which ordered the State to pay compensation to the victim's family. The State appealed the decision, leading to the current hearing.

Legal Issues/Questions Presented: The primary legal question was whether the State was liable for the death of the victim due to its failure to maintain law and order and protect the life of its citizens.

Applicable Legal Provisions: The case primarily revolves around the interpretation and application of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the right to life.

Holding(s): The court upheld the lower court's decision and held that the State was indeed liable for the death of the victim. The court ordered the State to pay compensation to the victim's family.

Legal Reasoning/Rationale: The court reasoned that the State has a public duty to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens, including the right to life. The court found that there was a complete intelligence failure on the part of the State, and had proper intelligence been gathered and precautionary measures taken, the incident could have been prevented. The court concluded that the victim's death was due to the negligence and callousness of the police, for which the State is absolutely liable.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established or Applied: The court applied the principle that the State has a constitutional obligation to protect the life, liberty, and property of a person. If the State fails in this duty, resulting in loss to a person, the State cannot avoid its responsibility.

It establishes that the State can be held liable for its failure to fulfill this duty, which can have significant implications for future cases involving similar circumstances.

Comments or Analysis: The case highlights the importance of the State's duty to protect its citizens and the potential consequences of failing to fulfill this duty.
