Legal Proposition: The Palai Central Bank Ltd., a banking company incorporated under the Travancore Companies Act, challenged the decision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to wind it up. The bank argued that the RBI's decision was violative of its fundamental rights under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution.

Legal Issues/Questions Presented: The primary legal question presented in this case was whether the Reserve Bank of India's decision to wind up the Palai Central Bank Ltd. was legal and whether it violated the bank's fundamental rights under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. The court also considered the question of whether a company can challenge the very statute that gave it life and made it a person.

The court also noted that the bank was already a person when the Constitution came into force, and any restrictive law thereafter made would have to satisfy the test of reasonableness laid down in Clauses 5 and 6 of Article 19 if it is to survive.

Rule of Law/Legal Principle Established or Applied: The court applied the principle that a company is a legal person because of the law that makes it one, and if that law chooses to limit its personality, then the creature of that very law cannot look to Article 19 for enlarging the rights which the law that brought it into existence thought fit to restrict.
